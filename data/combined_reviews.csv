App Store,6063 Bissonnet
App Store,Facebook need to check or vett all advertisements to avoid fraud
App Store,"Okay, There‚Äôs a lot of people that Don‚Äôt like fbook, I don‚Äôt care !! It has helped me find a lot of family kinfolks n has helped me Vent a million times Instead of holding it in to explode my Anxiety!!
It‚Äôs not Perfect n needs a lot of work But soo do We  üòçü•∞üôè‚ù£Ô∏è"
App Store,I use her I Dont log out
App Store,Too many unwanted ads and suggested pages.
App Store,Has too many ads
App Store,They will find a way to not monetize your account!
App Store,Facebook seems to be censoring people from posting anonymously in some groups. Even though this feature is available within the group(s) many not able to access it.
App Store,"I‚Äôm extremely unhappy with Facebook. They are still blocking the conservative voice, you will let the liberals talk all kinds of profanity and yet you block the conservative when they say one word about anything to them you call it bullying hate speech but when they do it, you do nothing so I‚Äôm gonna turn you into the FCC and that is a fact"
App Store,"They do not care about you, they only want you to spend money boosting content‚Ä¶ Meta is horrible!"
App Store,They steal sell use your info for wrong things look at past post to see if you have or may say something that might offend someone then they can delete your page for being human and having freedom of speech it‚Äôs lame and sad Facebook was the place to connect with people now it‚Äôs just unsafe like everything in this country it‚Äôs all backwards and everyone on the board needs to grow up
App Store,Love the comedians and the stories that have a beginning and end!! Like history and random information!
App Store,Go F yourself Zuckerberg
App Store,"Give everyone the same features, don‚Äôt just roll it out slowly. I.E. commenting anonymously."
App Store,All Good!
App Store,It‚Äôs been doing this for 1 weeks already and it‚Äôs not letting me react
App Store,"All my feed is suggested pages and advertisements. You don‚Äôt see your friends or pages you‚Äôve already joined. I guess times are hard at fb, they need more advertising money."
App Store,"I Can no longer support these people who are only out to destroy our country, our rights our freedom, and dismember everything we stand for and all for power and money. I hope those who voted for this A.H is getting everything you hoped for!"
App Store,I tired of getting from Facebook when I don‚Äôt do anything wrong
App Store,Only one star because the platform called Facebook owned by Meta violated repeatedly my constitutional right of free speech by removing my post and suspending my account multiple times. I don‚Äôt like having my rights infringed on.  Facebook is a woke one star company who leans to the left a socialist values of the democrats probably because they were paid off by the democratic side of the government.
App Store,Keeps crashing when using marketplace on my tablet. Everything is up to date. Idk
App Store,"This stupid app won‚Äôt let me change my password even though I don‚Äôt remember my old password but it‚Äôs stupid to ask for my old password, I tried to change it by giving it my phone number so it can give me a code but it won‚Äôt give me the new code"
App Store,I don‚Äôt like how ya play on peoples physiology
App Store,You will get out what you put in what you are is what you seek
App Store,Will not help you they don‚Äôt care
App Store,"I remember a time 10 years ago when Facebook was popping. There were flaws and it was losing users to Twitter but it was a good time.  Fast forward to about a year ago things have gotten bizarre. The bots are out of control. Everything is rage bait. Scammers have made marketplace unreliable. Ads are everywhere and often obscene (like straight up ads for p*rn games at times) and even Facebook dating has gone from a mildly embarrassing and creepy version of hinge to something unusable. Like why is it showing me people 4,000 miles away? And ultimately a lot of this can be blamed on the lack of actual human moderation. The AI tasked with policing is clearly not up to the task and it‚Äôs almost dangerous at this point. And in the most recent episode of nonsense, business accounts are being hit with massive amounts of spam the last few days. It genuinely feels like a bad social experiment at this point."
App Store,It‚Äôs honestly quite irritating to log out of your account and then when you log back in on the same device it kicks you out of being able to use marketplace. Not only that but it isn‚Äôt letting me verify anything to prove that this is indeed the correct device and I am of age to use marketplace. With that said I am gonna complain about the friggen help center too. It‚Äôs frustrating to use because it doesn‚Äôt ever lead you to a direct solution. At least that has been my experience for the problems I have had
App Store,Facebook is a hole. They care absolutely nothing about you. My account was stolen a week ago and I haven‚Äôt even gotten one reply from Facebook although I reported it multiple times as did my friends. They are asleep at the wheel and just want your attention so they can make a revenue. Go outside and ride a bike or read a book.
App Store,"Los mejores , gracias üßöüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòò"
App Store,"Still the number one site ever, I love FB forever"
App Store,Every time I use the voice feature to comment on something your enter button to post it always disappears fix it this is the 10th time I've had to say something about it
App Store,Be careful with this advertisement. I ordered one and never received it. They told me it got lost and they would only give me 60% refund. I even paid a shipping insurance and yet I haven‚Äôt even received that. Don‚Äôt order from here. It‚Äôs a scam.
App Store,I was told by someone to kill myself. I reported the comment and shared a screenshot to highlight the abuse. I was restricted and the original comment directed at me is still there.
App Store,Someone hacked my original account and now I‚Äôm locked out of it and trying to get help from facebook customer service good luck it‚Äôs a joke
App Store,i oove that
App Store,"The search bar keeps migrating down from the top by an inch or 2.  
This covers my top notification and the ""what's on your mind"" bar."
App Store,It‚Äôs awesome üï∫üèª
App Store,"YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH SAYING ANYTHING ON HERE hate speech, wishing death on people, you name in!"
App Store,I want to see my friends again. FB suggests I follow this and that but I‚Äôm already following hundreds of things and people that never seem to be in my feed. I‚Äôm less likely to see something if I‚Äôm following it. And forget about seeing my friends at all.
App Store,"Not unbiased, extremely far right. Allows hate speech and censors anything that doesn‚Äôt align with zuckbergs masters ,muskrat and don the con ."
App Store,Facebook will literally show you adds from fake accounts and when you repot the fake accounts they decline it and allow the fake accounts to stay up but yet they turn around and suspend real accounts for 180 days saying it‚Äôs a fake account. I was told my Facebook account goes against Facebook community standards and was surprised for 180 days so I applied it and sent a picture of myself to show I‚Äôm real but yet they still took my account down because they claimed it‚Äôs fake even with my actual picture of myself.
App Store,I have been trying to go live for four days and I cannot go live. I looked to see if this app needed to be updated. There‚Äôs no update. I‚Äôve contact creator support with no response. I have also restarted this app and I still cannot go live. It‚Äôs hindering me from growing as a content creator. This is not fun.
App Store,You can only be comfortable on FB if you‚Äôre a republican. This is a right wing app now along with all of meta.
App Store,Worth noting
App Store,Bad
App Store,Not worth it any day of the year
App Store,I like it
App Store,Give me five stars the main idea is that Facebook is the means to control us and leave of lost
